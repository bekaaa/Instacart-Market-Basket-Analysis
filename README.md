# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis

version 1.0.

Some notes regarding this version.

At this point I have  :

- predict_v1 and _v2 where v1 depends on product_freq matrix
	and v2 depends on per_user_freq + .5 product_freq.  
- Also get_product_freq v1 , 2, 3 and 4 [ check each of them for notes]  
- Next step is rewrite some of the scripts and apply a machine learning technique into it,
	So this version is just a backup for previous work.  
- *.ipynb files are just drafts.
